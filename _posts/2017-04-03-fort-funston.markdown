One of my all time favorite spots to hangout on weekends is Fort Funston in Daly city. It is a really nice 45-min scenic drive away along I-280. You park on a small cliff and walk down a short trail to the beach.

Fort Funston has something for everyone. You can find people hang-gliding over the beach. It's a pet-friendly beach. So if you love dogs, go to this beach on a pleasant evening. You can see people flying RC planes or drones.

One time, we even saw whales. That was pretty cool!
