I read this interesting post about technical debt on imgur engineering blog [link](https://blog.imgur.com/2013/08/27/tech-tuesday-technical-debt/). This post is a really (really) short summary of that post.

So there are 2 types of technical debts -
1. Intentional debt
  * created when you pick the quick and dirty hack in place of a more thought out and better solution in order to meet your deadlines (or because you are being lazy)
2. Unintentional debt
  * created by assumptions that turn out to be false
  * created by requirements that have changed
  * born out of poor design choices or poor implementations
